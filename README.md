# OSU_2023_MS_Project
This repository contains exploratory work done using R and my final capstone project.

My project was inspired by the article _Antibiotic Treatment Strategies for Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Adults_ (Postma 2015) and _Bayes factors for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence designs_ (Ravenzwaaij (2019). The R code utilized to perform the informed bayesian t-tests was sourced from https://osf.io/37vch/, which was last updated on 2018-12-14 and created by Quentin F. Gronau, Alexander Ly & Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. Their article _Informed Bayesian t-Tests_ (2020) in The American Statistician (DOI: 10.1080/00031305.2018.1562983) features results from using their code.
